-- orphan_cleanup.sql — REVIEW BEFORE RUNNING. Nothing here is destructive until step 3.
--
-- The store upserts and never deletes, so a contract removed from config.py stops producing new
-- rows while every row it already wrote stays exactly where it is. Two known cases:
--
--   Sky/burn_zero        removed when the Flapper mechanism was refuted. Its rows survived and
--                        rendered as a measured zero on a refuted mechanism, at full confidence.
--   Uniswap/fire_pit     re-pointed to the dead address. The next delta spanned the change and
--                        reported 111,337,581 UNI burned in a month against a real 100-134k/day.
--
-- Run steps 1 and 2 first. They only LOOK. Read what they print, then run step 3.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- STEP 1 — every distinct source in the store, with its span. LOOK ONLY.
-- Compare each against config.py: any source naming a contract key that is no longer there is an
-- orphan. `python -c "import config; print(sorted(config.PROJECT_BY_NAME['Sky']['contracts']))"`
