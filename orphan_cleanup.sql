-- orphan_cleanup.sql — REVIEW BEFORE RUNNING. Nothing here is destructive until step 3.
--
-- The store upserts and never deletes, so a contract removed from config.py stops producing new
-- rows while every row it already wrote stays exactly where it is. Two known cases:
--
--   Sky/burn_zero        removed when the Flapper mechanism was refuted. Its rows survived and
--                        rendered as a measured zero on a refuted mechanism, at full confidence.
--   Uniswap/fire_pit     re-pointed to the dead address. The next delta spanned the change and
--                        reported 111,337,581 UNI burned in a month against a real 100-134k/day.
--
-- Run steps 1 and 2 first. They only LOOK. Read what they print, then run step 3.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- STEP 1 — every distinct source in the store, with its span. LOOK ONLY.
-- Compare each against config.py: any source naming a contract key that is no longer there is an
-- orphan. `python -c "import config; print(sorted(config.PROJECT_BY_NAME['Sky']['contracts']))"`

-- 2026-09-14 — MAPLE treasury_holding_tokens: 0.51253570332391 SYRUP
--
-- NOT AN ORPHAN. The contract key `treasury` is still in config; what changed is that its
-- ROLE is now marked destination_status "disputed", so future runs stage the observation as
-- evidence and store no metric. But THE STORE UPSERTS AND NEVER DELETES, so the 0.51 row
-- already written stays as the latest value for this metric and keeps rendering.
--
-- The read was correct and the address was wrong: 0xa9466EaBd096449d650D5AEB0dD3dA6F52FD0B19
-- is Maple's v2 PROTOCOL FEE treasury, which takes fees in pool assets, not the wallet holding
-- repurchased SYRUP. Delete the row rather than leaving a real-but-meaningless figure in place.
--
-- Check first:
--   SELECT date, value, source FROM metrics
--    WHERE project='Maple' AND metric='treasury_holding_tokens' ORDER BY date;
--
-- Then delete:
DELETE FROM metrics
 WHERE project = 'Maple'
